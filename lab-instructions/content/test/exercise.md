## Craft an integration test suite for the ACME Brewery API!

The ACME Brewery is about to start implementing the ACME Brewery API but before jumping into the code, we will have to craft an integration test suite. This way, we can refine the business expectations and validate that our implementation, once developed, conforms to our specifications.

- Load [this collection](../../mock/exercise/postman_collection.json) in Postman, if not already done
- Examine the provided test cases
- Try to run a test in [Microcks]({{< param microcks_url >}}/#/services) against the generated mock

To complete your understanding, explain **for what purpose do we define tests before writing the implementation**.
